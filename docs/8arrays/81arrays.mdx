# One-Dimensional Arrays 

Arrays are like neat rows of parked cars, each with its own spot. A one-dimensional array is just a single row, perfect for keeping things in order! Let’s see how to use them in both pseudo-code and Python.

## **Declaration and Initialization**

### **Pseudo-Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE MyArray : ARRAY[1:5] OF INTEGER
MyArray[1] ← 10
MyArray[2] ← 20
MyArray[3] ← 30
MyArray[4] ← 40
MyArray[5] ← 50
```

### **Python:**
```python
MyArray = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

No need to declare the size beforehand in Python—just create and fill it!

## **Index-Based Access and Assignment**

### **Accessing Elements**

**Pseudo-Code:**
```plaintext
OUTPUT MyArray[3]
```

**Python:**
```python
print(MyArray[2])  # Python uses 0-based indexing
```

**Output:**
```
30
```
*"Third car in the row? It’s the shiny red one!"* 🚗✨

---

### **Changing an Element**

**Pseudo-Code:**
```plaintext
MyArray[2] ← 25
```

**Python:**
```python
MyArray[1] = 25
```

Now the second element is updated. 🚀

## **Example: Storing Student Marks 🎓**

**Pseudo-Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE Marks : ARRAY[1:3] OF INTEGER
Marks[1] ← 85
Marks[2] ← 90
Marks[3] ← 95
OUTPUT "First student scored: " + Marks[1]
```

**Python:**
```python
Marks = [85, 90, 95]
print("First student scored:", Marks[0])
```

**Output:**
```
First student scored: 85
```
*"You’ve got a bright class there!"* 🌟

## **Traversing the Array**

### **Pseudo-Code:**
```plaintext
FOR Index ← 1 TO 5
    OUTPUT MyArray[Index]
NEXT Index
```

### **Python:**
```python
for Index in range(5):
    print(MyArray[Index])
```

**Output:**
```
10
20
30
40
50
```
*"A walk down the row of cars, admiring each one."* 🚶‍♂️
