# Conditional Statements

Ah, the mighty conditional statements! Imagine you're the captain of a ship. As a captain, you make decisions like, “If there’s a storm, then steer away; otherwise, sail on!” These decision-making moments in programming are handled by the **IF-THEN** statements.

## IF-THEN: Making Choices

### The Basics

In pseudo-code, it looks like this:
```plaintext
IF Age > 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "You are an adult."
ENDIF
```

And in Python:
```python
if Age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```

Pretty straightforward, right? You check a condition (e.g., `Age > 18`), and if it’s true, you take an action.

### A Real-World Scenario

Let’s say you’re planning a party (and yes, snacks are mandatory):
```plaintext
DECLARE Age : INTEGER
INPUT Age
IF Age >= 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "Welcome to the party!"
ENDIF
```

Translated to Python:
```python
Age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if Age >= 18:
    print("Welcome to the party!")
```

Now run this and see what happens if you try sneaking in underage!

## ELSE: The Fork in the Road

But wait, what if someone doesn’t meet the criteria? You can’t just leave them hanging! This is where **ELSE** comes in:
```plaintext
IF Age >= 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "Welcome to the party!"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Sorry, this party is for adults only."
ENDIF
```

In Python:
```python
Age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
if Age >= 18:
    print("Welcome to the party!")
else:
    print("Sorry, this party is for adults only.")
```

It’s like a magical fork in the road: if the first path doesn’t work, the second one comes to the rescue.

## ELSEIF: Handling Multiple Choices

Now, sometimes you have more than two options. Imagine you’re running a food stall, and the customer has three choices:
- Chips
- Burgers
- Pizza

Here’s how you handle it:
```plaintext
DECLARE Choice : STRING
INPUT Choice
IF Choice = "Chips" THEN
    OUTPUT "Here are your chips!"
ELSEIF Choice = "Burger" THEN
    OUTPUT "Enjoy your burger!"
ELSEIF Choice = "Pizza" THEN
    OUTPUT "Pizza coming right up!"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Sorry, we don’t have that."
ENDIF
```

In Python:
```python
Choice = input("What would you like? Chips, Burger, or Pizza? ")
if Choice == "Chips":
    print("Here are your chips!")
elif Choice == "Burger":
    print("Enjoy your burger!")
elif Choice == "Pizza":
    print("Pizza coming right up!")
else:
    print("Sorry, we don’t have that.")
```

Go ahead, run this, and see if your code gets hungry!

# Loops

Loops are like having a magical repeat button. Instead of writing the same lines of code over and over, you can loop through your tasks.

---

## FOR Loops: The Workhorse of Repetition

Imagine you’re handing out chocolates to your classmates. Instead of saying, “Here’s one chocolate, here’s another,” you can just write:
```plaintext
FOR Counter ← 1 TO 5
    OUTPUT "Here’s a chocolate!"
NEXT Counter
```

In Python:
```python
for Counter in range(1, 6):
    print("Here’s a chocolate!")
```

### Behind the Scenes

The loop starts with `Counter = 1` and runs until `Counter = 5`. Each time it loops, it increases `Counter` by 1 automatically. Handy, right?

---

## WHILE Loops: When You Don’t Know When to Stop

Sometimes, you don’t know how many times something will repeat. Maybe you’re waiting for your pet dog to bark, and only then will you stop:
```plaintext
DECLARE DogBarked : BOOLEAN
DogBarked ← FALSE
WHILE DogBarked = FALSE DO
    OUTPUT "Waiting for the dog to bark..."
    // Imagine DogBarked is updated when the dog barks
ENDWHILE
```

In Python:
```python
DogBarked = False
while not DogBarked:
    print("Waiting for the dog to bark...")
    # Simulate the dog barking
    DogBarked = True
```

---

## REPEAT-UNTIL Loops: The One That Guarantees a Try

A **REPEAT-UNTIL** loop guarantees at least one execution, no matter what. Think of it like trying to guess a password (don’t actually hack, though!):
```plaintext
DECLARE Password : STRING
REPEAT
    OUTPUT "Guess the password:"
    INPUT Password
UNTIL Password = "OpenSesame"
```

In Python:
```python
Password = ""
while True:
    Password = input("Guess the password: ")
    if Password == "OpenSesame":
        print("You guessed it!")
        break
```

# Loops + Conditions: The Ultimate Combo

Loops and conditions together are like peanut butter and jelly—they just work! Let’s say you want to print the first 10 even numbers:
```plaintext
DECLARE Number : INTEGER
Number ← 2
WHILE Number <= 20 DO
    OUTPUT Number
    Number ← Number + 2
ENDWHILE
```

In Python:
```python
Number = 2
while Number <= 20:
    print(Number)
    Number += 2
```

# A Fun Challenge for You!

Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for their favourite number.
2. If the number is less than 10, print "Small number!"
3. If the number is between 10 and 50, print "Medium number!"
4. If the number is above 50, print "Big number!"

Need a hint? Use **IF-THEN-ELSE** and maybe a loop if you want to keep asking for numbers until the user types `0` to quit.

Now you know the secrets of **control structures**! Go forth, young coder, and make your programs dance to the beat of your logic. And remember: the power of loops and conditions lies in making your life easier—so use them wisely and have fun!
