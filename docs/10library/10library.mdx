# Library Routines 🎩* 

Welcome to the world of **library routines**! These are like secret agents in your code—quick, efficient, and always ready to do the heavy lifting. From finding remainders to generating random numbers, these routines save the day when the going gets tough. Let’s explore their magical powers and how they translate from pseudo-code to Python. And yes, there might be some cheeky humour ahead. 😉

## **MOD (Remainder of Division)**  

Think of `MOD` as the nosy neighbour—it peeks into your numbers and tells you what’s left over after division.  

**Pseudo-Code Example:**  
```plaintext  
Value1 ← MOD(10, 3) // Remainder of 10 ÷ 3  
Value2 ← 10 MOD 4 // Remainder of 10 ÷ 4  
```  

**Python Translation:**  
```python  
Value1 = 10 % 3  # Remainder of 10 ÷ 3  
Value2 = 10 % 4  # Remainder of 10 ÷ 4  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Value1 = 1  
Value2 = 2  
```  

:::tip Did you know?  
The `MOD` operator is perfect for detecting even and odd numbers. If `x % 2 == 0`, congratulations—it’s even! Otherwise, it’s a quirky oddball.  
:::  

**Fun Example:**  
**Scenario:** You’re dividing pizza slices among your friends, but there’s always that one leftover slice.  

```plaintext  
Slices ← 7  
Friends ← 3  
Leftover ← Slices MOD Friends  
OUTPUT "Leftover slice count: ", Leftover  
```  

**Python:**  
```python  
Slices = 7  
Friends = 3  
Leftover = Slices % Friends  
print("Leftover slice count:", Leftover)  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Leftover slice count: 1  
```  
*"Who gets the last slice? The one with the best puppy eyes!"* 🐶🍕

## **DIV (Quotient of Division)**  

`DIV` is the no-nonsense accountant—it gives you the whole number part of division, ignoring the messy decimals.  

**Pseudo-Code Example:**  
```plaintext  
Value1 ← DIV(10, 3) // Quotient of 10 ÷ 3  
Value2 ← 15 DIV 4 // Quotient of 15 ÷ 4  
```  

**Python Translation:**  
```python  
Value1 = 10 // 3  # Quotient of 10 ÷ 3  
Value2 = 15 // 4  # Quotient of 15 ÷ 4  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Value1 = 3  
Value2 = 3  
```  

:::danger Watch Out!  
`DIV` doesn’t care about the remainder. If you’re expecting decimals, you might feel shortchanged! Use `/` for proper division.  
:::  

**Fun Example:**  
**Scenario:** You’re splitting chocolates among friends but being strict about fairness.  

```plaintext  
Chocolates ← 10  
Friends ← 3  
EachFriend ← Chocolates DIV Friends  
OUTPUT "Each friend gets: ", EachFriend  
```  

**Python:**  
```python  
Chocolates = 10  
Friends = 3  
EachFriend = Chocolates // Friends  
print("Each friend gets:", EachFriend)  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Each friend gets: 3  
```  
*"The leftover chocolates? That’s a bribe for the one counting."* 🍫😏

## **ROUND (Rounding to Decimal Places)**  

`ROUND` is the perfectionist—it smooths out those pesky decimals to the desired number of places.  

**Pseudo-Code Example:**  
```plaintext  
Value1 ← ROUND(6.97354, 2) // Round to 2 decimal places  
Value2 ← ROUND(3.14159, 3) // Round to 3 decimal places  
```  

**Python Translation:**  
```python  
Value1 = round(6.97354, 2)  # Round to 2 decimal places  
Value2 = round(3.14159, 3)  # Round to 3 decimal places  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Value1 = 6.97  
Value2 = 3.142  
```  

:::tip Did you know?  
`ROUND` can be used to control the precision of calculations, especially when you’re dealing with scary big numbers—like calculating how many fries you’ve eaten this year. 🍟  
:::  

**Fun Example:**  
**Scenario:** Calculating your average quiz score but keeping it neat.  

```plaintext  
TotalScore ← 86.374  
Tests ← 3  
Average ← ROUND(TotalScore DIV Tests, 2)  
OUTPUT "Your average score is: ", Average  
```  

**Python:**  
```python  
TotalScore = 86.374  
Tests = 3  
Average = round(TotalScore / Tests, 2)  
print("Your average score is:", Average)  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Your average score is: 28.79  
```  
*"And no, you can’t round your score to an A+!"* 📝😂

## **RANDOM (Random Number Generation)**  

`RANDOM` is the mischievous one—it pulls a number out of thin air, keeping things exciting!  

**Pseudo-Code Example:**  
```plaintext  
Value ← RANDOM() // Generate a random number between 0 and 1  
```  

**Python Translation:**  
```python  
import random  
Value = random.random()  # Generate a random number between 0 and 1  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
Value = 0.47853  
```  

**Fun Example:**  
**Scenario:** Rolling a dice to see who pays the pizza bill.  

```plaintext  
DiceRoll ← ROUND(RANDOM() * 6 + 1, 0)  
OUTPUT "You rolled: ", DiceRoll  
```  

**Python:**  
```python  
import random  
DiceRoll = round(random.random() * 6 + 1, 0)  
print("You rolled:", DiceRoll)  
```  

**Output:**  
```plaintext  
You rolled: 4  
```  
*"Whoever rolls the lowest pays—no cheating!"* 🎲🍕
