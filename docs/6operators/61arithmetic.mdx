# Arithmetic Operators ➕➖✖️➗

Arithmetic operators are like the Swiss Army knives of coding – they’re essential, versatile, and often the key to solving everything from everyday calculations to complex puzzles. Let’s dive into the magical world of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, learning how to wield these operators in both **Pseudo Code** and **Python** – and of course, have a laugh or two along the way! 😄

## **Addition: Making Numbers Friends 🤝**

**Pseudo Code Example 1: Counting Apples 🍎**
```plaintext
DECLARE Apples1, Apples2, TotalApples : INTEGER
Apples1 ← 5
Apples2 ← 7
TotalApples ← Apples1 + Apples2
OUTPUT "You have ", TotalApples, " apples."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
Apples1 = 5
Apples2 = 7
TotalApples = Apples1 + Apples2
print("You have", TotalApples, "apples.")
```

**Output:**
```
You have 12 apples.
```
*“An apple a day keeps the bugs away... or does it?” 🍏*

**Pseudo Code Example 2: Friendship Test 🤗**
```plaintext
DECLARE FriendsA, FriendsB, TotalFriends : INTEGER
FriendsA ← 3
FriendsB ← 4
TotalFriends ← FriendsA + FriendsB
OUTPUT "You have ", TotalFriends, " friends."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
FriendsA = 3
FriendsB = 4
TotalFriends = FriendsA + FriendsB
print("You have", TotalFriends, "friends.")
```

**Output:**
```
You have 7 friends.
```
*“I’m still suspicious of those extra friends. Are they real?” 🤔*

## **Subtraction: Bye-Bye Numbers! 👋**

**Pseudo Code Example 1: Chocolate Disappearance 🍫**
```plaintext
DECLARE Chocolates, EatenChocolates, RemainingChocolates : INTEGER
Chocolates ← 10
EatenChocolates ← 4
RemainingChocolates ← Chocolates - EatenChocolates
OUTPUT "You have ", RemainingChocolates, " chocolates left."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
Chocolates = 10
EatenChocolates = 4
RemainingChocolates = Chocolates - EatenChocolates
print("You have", RemainingChocolates, "chocolates left.")
```

**Output:**
```
You have 6 chocolates left.
```
*“The mystery of the disappearing chocolates continues…”* 🕵️‍♂️

## **Multiplication: The Power of Groups 💪**

**Pseudo Code Example 1: Tables for Breakfast 🍳**
```plaintext
DECLARE Number, Times, Product : INTEGER
Number ← 3
Times ← 5
Product ← Number * Times
OUTPUT "3 multiplied by 5 is ", Product
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
Number = 3
Times = 5
Product = Number * Times
print("3 multiplied by 5 is", Product)
```

**Output:**
```
3 multiplied by 5 is 15
```

**Pseudo Code Example 2: Party Planning 🎉**
```plaintext
DECLARE People, Pizzas, TotalSlices : INTEGER
People ← 4
Pizzas ← 2
TotalSlices ← People * Pizzas
OUTPUT "You need ", TotalSlices, " slices of pizza."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
People = 4
Pizzas = 2
TotalSlices = People * Pizzas
print("You need", TotalSlices, "slices of pizza.")
```

**Output:**
```
You need 8 slices of pizza.
```
*“Pizza maths: the only maths everyone loves!”* 🍕

## **Division: Sharing is Caring 🧮**

**Pseudo Code Example 1: Splitting Gold Coins ⚱️**
```plaintext
DECLARE GoldCoins, Pirates, GoldPerPirate : REAL
GoldCoins ← 100
Pirates ← 5
GoldPerPirate ← GoldCoins / Pirates
OUTPUT "Each pirate gets ", GoldPerPirate, " gold coins."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
GoldCoins = 100


```python
Pirates = 5
GoldPerPirate = GoldCoins / Pirates
print("Each pirate gets", GoldPerPirate, "gold coins.")
```

**Output:**
```
Each pirate gets 20.0 gold coins.
```
*“Arr matey, now that’s fair pirate loot!” 🏴‍☠️*

**Pseudo Code Example 2: Sharing Cupcakes 🧁**
```plaintext
DECLARE Cupcakes, Friends, CupcakesPerFriend : REAL
Cupcakes ← 24
Friends ← 6
CupcakesPerFriend ← Cupcakes / Friends
OUTPUT "Each friend gets ", CupcakesPerFriend, " cupcakes."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
Cupcakes = 24
Friends = 6
CupcakesPerFriend = Cupcakes / Friends
print("Each friend gets", CupcakesPerFriend, "cupcakes.")
```

**Output:**
```
Each friend gets 4.0 cupcakes.
```
*“Cupcakes for all! Sharing is sweet!”* 🧁

## **Bonus Fun: Combined Operations 🥳**

**Pseudo Code Example 1: Complex Maths Adventure 🧙‍♂️**
```plaintext
DECLARE a, b, c, result : REAL
a ← 10
b ← 5
c ← 3
result ← (a + b) * c / 2
OUTPUT "The result of the operation is ", result
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
a = 10
b = 5
c = 3
result = (a + b) * c / 2
print("The result of the operation is", result)
```

**Output:**
```
The result of the operation is 22.5
```

**Pseudo Code Example 2: Speeding Cars 🚗💨**
```plaintext
DECLARE Distance, Time, Speed : REAL
Distance ← 100
Time ← 2
Speed ← Distance / Time
OUTPUT "The car's speed is ", Speed, " km/h."
```

**Python Equivalent:**
```python
Distance = 100
Time = 2
Speed = Distance / Time
print("The car's speed is", Speed, "km/h.")
```

**Output:**
```
The car's speed is 50.0 km/h.
```
*“Fast and curious!”* 🚀
