# Comparison Operators 💃🕺

Comparison operators are the ultimate decision-makers in programming. They let you compare values and decide which one is bigger, better, or just plain equal. From checking if two values are the same to finding out who’s taller in a room full of shorties, comparison operators have got you covered. Let’s explore their quirks with some spicy examples that will bring your pseudo-code and Python skills to life. 😏

## **What are Comparison Operators?**

Here’s the cast of characters in the world of comparison:

- **`=` or `==`**: Equal to.
- **`<>` or `!=`**: Not equal to.
- **`>`**: Greater than.
- **`<`**: Less than.
- **`>=`**: Greater than or equal to.
- **`<=`**: Less than or equal to.

## **Examples with Comparison Operators**

### **Example 1: Who’s Got the Bigger Pizza Slice? 🍕**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE MySlice, FriendSlice : INTEGER
MySlice ← 8
FriendSlice ← 6

IF MySlice > FriendSlice THEN
    OUTPUT "My slice is bigger! 😎"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Friend's slice is bigger... unfair! 😢"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
MySlice = 8
FriendSlice = 6

if MySlice > FriendSlice:
    print("My slice is bigger! 😎")
else:
    print("Friend's slice is bigger... unfair! 😢")
```

**Output:**
```
My slice is bigger! 😎
```
*"Always grab the bigger slice, folks!"* 🍴

### **Example 2: Is Your Crush Single? 💔**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE RelationshipStatus : STRING
RelationshipStatus ← "Single"

IF RelationshipStatus = "Single" THEN
    OUTPUT "You’ve got a chance! 🥰"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Move on, mate. 😔"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
RelationshipStatus = "Single"

if RelationshipStatus == "Single":
    print("You’ve got a chance! 🥰")
else:
    print("Move on, mate. 😔")
```

**Output:**
```
You’ve got a chance! 🥰
```
*"Keep the charm, but respect the boundaries!"* 😇

### **Example 3: The Mysterious Age Game 🎂**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE Age : INTEGER
Age ← 18

IF Age >= 18 THEN
    OUTPUT "Welcome to adulthood! 🎉"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Still a kiddo! 🍭"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
Age = 18

if Age >= 18:
    print("Welcome to adulthood! 🎉")
else:
    print("Still a kiddo! 🍭")
```

**Output:**
```
Welcome to adulthood! 🎉
```
*"Age is just a number, but don’t tell that to the bouncer!"* 🥂

### **Example 4: Bank Balance Check 💰**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE MyBalance : REAL
MyBalance ← 100.50

IF MyBalance < 0 THEN
    OUTPUT "You're broke, mate. 😭"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Living the rich life! 💸"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
MyBalance = 100.50

if MyBalance < 0:
    print("You're broke, mate. 😭")
else:
    print("Living the rich life! 💸")
```

**Output:**
```
Living the rich life! 💸
```
*"Savings: the ultimate glow-up!"* 💎

### **Example 5: Who Gets the Last Chocolate? 🍫**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE YourChocolate, MyChocolate : INTEGER
YourChocolate ← 2
MyChocolate ← 2

IF YourChocolate = MyChocolate THEN
    OUTPUT "Let’s share the last one! 😇"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "It's mine! 😤"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
YourChocolate = 2
MyChocolate = 2

if YourChocolate == MyChocolate:
    print("Let’s share the last one! 😇")
else:
    print("It's mine! 😤")
```

**Output:**
```
Let’s share the last one! 😇
```
*"Sharing is caring… sometimes."* 🍬

### **Example 6: Height Comparison at the Club 🕺💃**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE MyHeight, MinHeight : INTEGER
MyHeight ← 170
MinHeight ← 165

IF MyHeight >= MinHeight THEN
    OUTPUT "You’re tall enough to enter! 🕺"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Sorry, not tall enough. 😞"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
MyHeight = 170
MinHeight = 165

if MyHeight >= MinHeight:
    print("You’re tall enough to enter! 🕺")
else:
    print("Sorry, not tall enough. 😞")
```

**Output:**
```
You’re tall enough to enter! 🕺
```
*"Wear heels next time if you’re borderline!"* 👠

### **Example 7: The Better Exam Score 📚**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE MyScore, FriendScore : INTEGER
MyScore ← 85
FriendScore ← 90

IF MyScore > FriendScore THEN
    OUTPUT "I aced it! 🎉"
ELSEIF MyScore = FriendScore THEN
    OUTPUT "We both nailed it! 🎯"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Better luck next time. 😅"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
MyScore = 85
FriendScore = 90

if MyScore > FriendScore:
    print("I aced it! 🎉")
elif MyScore == FriendScore:
    print("We both nailed it! 🎯")
else:
    print("Better luck next time. 😅")
```

**Output:**
```
Better luck next time. 😅
```
*"It’s not about winning; it’s about pretending you didn’t care!"* 😂

### **Example 8: Late Night Pizza Orders 🍕**

**Pseudo Code:**
```plaintext
DECLARE PizzaCount : INTEGER
PizzaCount ← 5

IF PizzaCount <> 0 THEN
    OUTPUT "There’s still pizza left! 🍕"
ELSE
    OUTPUT "All gone. 😭"
ENDIF
```

**Python:**
```python
PizzaCount = 5

if PizzaCount != 0:
    print("There’s still pizza left! 🍕")
else:
    print("All gone. 😭")
```

**Output:**
```
There’s still pizza left! 🍕
