# Error Handling and Edge Cases: Embracing the Unexpected!

Let’s face it, errors are inevitable in programming. But don’t worry, handling errors and those pesky edge cases is what separates a coding wizard from a mere muggle. 🧙‍♂️ In this chapter, we’ll learn how to gracefully handle errors, tackle conversion issues, and debug like a pro.

## **Handling Invalid Inputs** 🎭

Imagine your code is asking for an age, but someone enters "banana." 🍌 Uh-oh, what now? That’s where error handling comes in. Python gives us a safety net called `try` and `except` to catch and manage these situations.

### **Pseudo-Code Example**  
```plaintext
DECLARE Age : INTEGER  
OUTPUT "Please enter your age:"  
INPUT Age  
IF Age < 0 THEN  
    OUTPUT "Age cannot be negative!"  
ENDIF  
```

### **Python Translation**  
```python
try:
    Age = int(input("Please enter your age: "))
    if Age < 0:
        print("Age cannot be negative!")
    else:
        print(f"Your age is {Age}.")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
```

### **What happens?**
1. If you input `25`, it will print:  
   ```
   Your age is 25.
   ```

2. If you input `"banana"`, it will catch the error and say:  
   ```
   Invalid input! Please enter a number.
   ```

## **Common Conversion Issues** 🌀

Conversions are a common source of bugs. For example, converting `"123abc"` to an integer? Nope, Python won’t let that slide.

### **Pseudo-Code Example**  
```plaintext
DECLARE Number : INTEGER  
INPUT Number  
OUTPUT "Your number doubled is:", Number * 2  
```

### **Python Translation**  
```python
try:
    Number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(f"Your number doubled is: {Number * 2}")
except ValueError:
    print("Oops! That's not a valid number.")
```

### **Pro Tip 🧙**  
Always validate user input before processing it. For instance, use `str.isdigit()` to check if the input is a number.

## **Edge Cases**: Thinking Outside the Box 📦  

Edge cases are those sneaky little scenarios that break your code when you least expect it. Here’s how to handle them.

### **Edge Case 1: Zero Division**  
Division by zero? That’s a no-go. But Python can catch it.

**Pseudo-Code Example**  
```plaintext
DECLARE Dividend : REAL  
DECLARE Divisor : REAL  
INPUT Dividend, Divisor  
IF Divisor = 0 THEN  
    OUTPUT "Cannot divide by zero!"  
ELSE  
    OUTPUT Dividend / Divisor  
ENDIF  
```

**Python Translation**  
```python
try:
    Dividend = float(input("Enter the dividend: "))
    Divisor = float(input("Enter the divisor: "))
    if Divisor == 0:
        print("Cannot divide by zero!")
    else:
        print(f"The result is: {Dividend / Divisor}")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter numbers only.")
```

---

### **Edge Case 2: Empty Input**  
What if someone just presses enter without entering anything?

**Pseudo-Code Example**  
```plaintext
DECLARE Name : STRING  
OUTPUT "Enter your name:"  
INPUT Name  
IF Name = "" THEN  
    OUTPUT "Name cannot be empty!"  
ENDIF  
```

**Python Translation**  
```python
Name = input("Enter your name: ").strip()
if not Name:
    print("Name cannot be empty!")
else:
    print(f"Hello, {Name}!")
```

---

### **Edge Case 3: Out of Bounds**  
What if you access an array index that doesn’t exist?

**Pseudo-Code Example**  
```plaintext
DECLARE Array[1:5] OF INTEGER  
OUTPUT "Enter an index to access:"  
INPUT Index  
IF Index < 1 OR Index > 5 THEN  
    OUTPUT "Index out of bounds!"  
ENDIF  
```

**Python Translation**  
```python
Array = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
try:
    Index = int(input("Enter an index (1-5) to access: ")) - 1
    print(f"Value at index {Index + 1}: {Array[Index]}")
except IndexError:
    print("Index out of bounds!")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input! Please enter a number.")
```

## **Tips for Debugging** 🕵️‍♀️

1. **Print Statements Are Your Best Friend:**  
   Add print statements to check values at various stages. Think of it as leaving breadcrumbs to track what’s happening.

2. **Rubber Duck Debugging 🦆:**  
   Explain your code to a rubber duck (or a mate). You’ll often find the bug while explaining.

3. **Use Debuggers:**  
   Python’s built-in `pdb` or IDE tools let you step through your code and inspect variables.

4. **Log Errors:**  
   Use the `logging` library to record errors for later analysis.

### **Python Example: Logging Errors**
```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.ERROR)

try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    logging.error("Attempted to divide by zero.")
    print("An error occurred, but we logged it for you!")
```

:::tip **Did You Know?**  
The term "bug" originated when a real moth got stuck in an early computer, causing it to malfunction. So, when you debug your code, imagine you’re chasing moths. 🦋
