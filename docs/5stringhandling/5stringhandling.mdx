# String Handling

### Let’s Play with Words! ✨

Strings are like the words and sentences of programming—they're everywhere! And just like words, you can measure them, chop them up, shout them in uppercase, or whisper in lowercase. Let’s explore the magical world of **string handling** with some fun examples! 🧙‍♂️

## LENGTH: How Long Is Your String? 📏

Have you ever wondered how long a sentence is? The `LENGTH` function is here to tell you. In pseudo-code, it’s as simple as:

```plaintext
DECLARE MyString : STRING
MyString ← "Programming is fun!"
OUTPUT LENGTH(MyString)
```

In Python, you’d do this:
```python
MyString = "Programming is fun!"
print(len(MyString))
```

**Output:**  
`19` (Yes, spaces count too!)

### Fun Challenge 🎉:
- Try this: `LENGTH("Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious")`
- Write a Python program to ask the user for their name and print its length. What’s the length of your name? 👀

## SUBSTRING: Cutting the Cake 🎂

Let’s say you’ve got a long word, but you just want a slice of it. That’s where `SUBSTRING` comes in handy!

### Syntax in Pseudo-Code:
```plaintext
DECLARE MyString : STRING
MyString ← "Docusaurus is awesome!"
OUTPUT SUBSTRING(MyString, 1, 9)
```

**Translation to Python:**
```python
MyString = "Docusaurus is awesome!"
print(MyString[0:9])  # Remember, Python starts counting from 0!
```

**Output:**  
`Docusaur`

### Another Example 🎯:
Want the last 7 letters of "Superhero"?  
```python
MyString = "Superhero"
print(MyString[-7:])  # This grabs the last 7 characters
```

**Output:**  
`perhero`

### Fun Challenge 🎉:
- Extract the word "awesome" from the sentence: `"Learning to code is awesome and fun!"`

## UCASE: SHOUT IT OUT LOUD! 📢

Sometimes, you need to **shout**. Whether you’re excited or just want to emphasise something, `UCASE` turns all your letters into uppercase.

### Pseudo-Code:
```plaintext
DECLARE Greeting : STRING
Greeting ← "hello, world!"
OUTPUT UCASE(Greeting)
```

**Python Translation:**
```python
Greeting = "hello, world!"
print(Greeting.upper())
```

**Output:**  
`HELLO, WORLD!`

### Fun with UCASE:
```python
Excitement = "coding is the best!"
print(Excitement.upper())
```

**Output:**  
`CODING IS THE BEST!`  

---

## LCASE: Whisper Softly... 🤫

If shouting is too loud for your taste, how about **whispering**? `LCASE` transforms everything into lowercase, perfect for a gentle tone.

### Pseudo-Code:
```plaintext
DECLARE Announcement : STRING
Announcement ← "PYTHON IS AWESOME!"
OUTPUT LCASE(Announcement)
```

**Python Translation:**
```python
Announcement = "PYTHON IS AWESOME!"
print(Announcement.lower())
```

**Output:**  
`python is awesome!`

### Real-Life Example 🌟:
If you’re working with user input, you might want to standardise the case:
```python
UserInput = input("Type Yes or No: ")
if UserInput.lower() == "yes":
    print("Great! Let’s move on.")
```

## Putting It All Together 🎉

Let’s combine all these string-handling tricks into one awesome program. Here’s an example to play with:

### Pseudo-Code:
```plaintext
DECLARE Sentence : STRING
Sentence ← "Coding is magical!"
OUTPUT "Length: ", LENGTH(Sentence)
OUTPUT "Uppercase: ", UCASE(Sentence)
OUTPUT "Lowercase: ", LCASE(Sentence)
OUTPUT "Substring: ", SUBSTRING(Sentence, 8, 7)
```

### Python Translation:
```python
Sentence = "Coding is magical!"
print("Length:", len(Sentence))
print("Uppercase:", Sentence.upper())
print("Lowercase:", Sentence.lower())
print("Substring:", Sentence[7:14])
```

**Output:**
```
Length: 18
Uppercase: CODING IS MAGICAL!
Lowercase: coding is magical!
Substring: is magi
```

### A Fun Challenge for You! 🧩

1. Ask the user to enter their favourite quote.
2. Print:
   - The length of the quote.
   - The quote in uppercase and lowercase.
   - A substring of the first 5 characters.
3. Add a funny comment if the length of the quote is more than 50 characters, like, “Wow, that’s a long quote! Are you writing a novel?” 😄
