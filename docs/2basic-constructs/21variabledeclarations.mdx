# Variable Declarations

## What are Variables? üßÆ

Think of variables as **magic boxes** where you can store data‚Äînumbers, words, or even *true/false* statements! These boxes come with **labels** (names) so you can find them easily.

In pseudo-code, variables are declared using the `DECLARE` keyword. Let‚Äôs dive into this exciting world of **variable declarations** and see how to convert them to Python.

## Syntax in Pseudo-Code

Here‚Äôs how variables are declared in pseudo-code:

```vb
DECLARE VariableName : DataType
```

### Examples:
```vb
DECLARE Age : INTEGER
DECLARE Name : STRING
DECLARE Temperature : REAL
DECLARE IsStudent : BOOLEAN
```

## Conversion to Python üêç

In Python, there‚Äôs no need to use `DECLARE` or specify the type of data. You simply assign a value, and Python figures out the type automatically. Amazing, right?

Here‚Äôs how the above pseudo-code converts to Python:

```python title="Variable Declarations in Python"
Age = 0  # INTEGER
Name = ""  # STRING
Temperature = 0.0  # REAL
IsStudent = False  # BOOLEAN
```

## Supported Data Types

| Pseudo-Code Data Type | Python Equivalent | Example         |
|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| INTEGER               | `int`            | `Age = 16`      |
| STRING                | `str`            | `Name = "Alice"`|
| REAL                  | `float`          | `Temperature = 36.5` |
| BOOLEAN               | `bool`           | `IsStudent = True` |

:::tip Pro Tip
In Python, variable names are **case-sensitive**, so `age` and `Age` are different variables. Keep this in mind to avoid sneaky bugs!

## Let‚Äôs Practice üìù

Try converting these pseudo-code declarations into Python:

```vb title="Challenge"
DECLARE Score : INTEGER
DECLARE Greeting : STRING
DECLARE PiValue : REAL
DECLARE IsRainy : BOOLEAN
```

**Python Solution**:

```python
Score = 0
Greeting = ""
PiValue = 0.0
IsRainy = False
```

**Great job! üéâ**
