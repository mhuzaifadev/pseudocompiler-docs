# Constants

## What are Constants? 🌟

Constants are like **permanent markers**—once you write something, it stays that way! These are values in your program that never change.

In pseudo-code, constants are declared using the `CONSTANT` keyword. Let’s see how they work and how to convert them to Python.

## Syntax in Pseudo-Code

Here’s how constants are declared in pseudo-code:

```vb
CONSTANT ConstantName ← Value
```

### Examples:
```vb
CONSTANT Pi ← 3.14159
CONSTANT SchoolName ← "Greenwood High"
CONSTANT MaxScore ← 100
```

## Conversion to Python 🐍

In Python, we don’t have a special `CONSTANT` keyword. Instead, we use **uppercase variable names** as a convention to show they shouldn’t be changed.

Here’s how the above pseudo-code converts to Python:

```python title="Constants in Python"
PI = 3.14159  # Constant for Pi
SCHOOL_NAME = "Greenwood High"  # Name of the school
MAX_SCORE = 100  # Maximum score
```

## Why Use Constants? 🤔

- **Prevent Mistakes**: Keeps important values from being accidentally changed.
- **Improve Readability**: Makes your code easier to understand.
- **Consistent Naming**: Ensures everyone knows these values won’t change.

:::note Fun Fact
In Python, there’s nothing stopping you from changing a "constant" value. But just because you *can*, doesn’t mean you *should*. Stick to the rules for cleaner code!

## Let’s Practice 📝

Convert these pseudo-code constants into Python:

```vb title="Challenge"
CONSTANT SpeedOfLight ← 299792458
CONSTANT GoldenRatio ← 1.618
CONSTANT WelcomeMessage ← "Hello, World!"
```

**Python Solution**:

```python
SPEED_OF_LIGHT = 299792458
GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.618
WELCOME_MESSAGE = "Hello, World!"
```

**Well done, future coding genius! 🎓✨**
