# Output Statements

Now that we’ve mastered getting inputs, let’s talk about presenting the results. The `OUTPUT` statement in pseudo-code becomes `print()` in Python. Let’s add some sparkle!

### **Basic `OUTPUT`**

#### Example:
In pseudo-code:
```plaintext
OUTPUT "Hello, World!"
```

Translated to Python:
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Result:
```
Hello, World!
```

### **Formatting Outputs**

#### **Concatenation**
In pseudo-code:
```plaintext
OUTPUT "Hello, " + Name
```

Translated to Python:
```python
Name = "Alice"
print("Hello, " + Name)
```

#### **Formatted Strings (f-strings)**
Let’s display age and name together:
```plaintext
DECLARE Age : INTEGER
DECLARE Name : STRING
OUTPUT "Hi " + Name + ", you are " + Age + " years old."
```

Translated to Python:
```python
Name = "Alice"
Age = 20
print(f"Hi {Name}, you are {Age} years old.")
```

### **Outputting Arrays**

#### **1D Arrays**
In pseudo-code:
```plaintext
DECLARE Colours : ARRAY[1:5] OF STRING
OUTPUT "Your favourite colours are:"
FOR Counter ← 1 TO 5
    OUTPUT Colours[Counter]
NEXT Counter
```

Translated to Python:
```python
Colours = ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow", "Purple"]
print("Your favourite colours are:")
for Colour in Colours:
    print(Colour)
```

#### **2D Arrays**
In pseudo-code:
```plaintext
DECLARE Grades : ARRAY[1:2, 1:3] OF INTEGER
OUTPUT "The grades are:"
FOR Row ← 1 TO 2
    FOR Col ← 1 TO 3
        OUTPUT Grades[Row, Col]
    NEXT Col
NEXT Row
```

Translated to Python:
```python
Grades = [[85, 90, 88], [92, 80, 85]]
print("The grades are:")
for Row in Grades:
    print(" ".join(map(str, Row)))  # Joins row elements with a space
```

### **Let’s Make It Fun!**
```python
Name = input("What’s your name? ")
Snack = input("What’s your favourite snack? ")
Age = int(input("How many years have you been enjoying snacks? "))

print(f"Hi {Name}! You’ve been enjoying {Snack} for {Age} years!")
```

Example output:
```
What’s your name? Alice
What’s your favourite snack? Chocolate
How many years have you been enjoying snacks? 10
Hi Alice! You’ve been enjoying Chocolate for 10 years!
```

### **Recap**
Input and output aren’t just about writing code—they’re about creating an engaging user experience. Whether you’re asking for a user’s name or printing an array of grades, you’re building a connection between the program and the user.

Remember: Always test your inputs (and watch out for users like your cheeky mate who enters a text string when you’re expecting a number)!
